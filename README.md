# Book_Library_Frontend

Developed a Book Library Frontend using HTML,CSS and Javascript. It includes splash page with signup and login option. Then it is redirected to homepage which displays featured books,new arrivals and different categories of books. Then when we click on buy now button it is redirected to payment page and finally the order is placed successfully.
